  Minor Fix:
    - Quality Module (Technology) is researched at the beginning of the game to unlock uncommon and rare quality.

Version: 1.0.0
Date: 15AUG2025
  Major Features:
    - Initial mod release!!
    - All machines that CAN have modules, DO have modules. It's a module party!
    - Modules are completely random!
    - Higher quality buildings have MORE MODULE SLOTS!!! EPIC! LEGENDARY!!
    - The player cannot have modules in their inventory and mined/deconstructed machines will lose their modules. No cheating!
    - Affected machines have an innate +5% to all possible effects!
    - Vanilla recipies are slightly altered to allow more module effects (i.e. electric furnaces can take prod).
    - Some early game items (and even some late) now take modules.
  Notes:
    - May have adverse reactions with other mods that deeply affect quality and/or modules (e.g. no-quality). Such interactions are largely untested. Buyer beware!
    - Please report any bugs/suggestions to the mod author!
